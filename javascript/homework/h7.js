//**Q.1**

supposedly we have a list of numbers [1,2,3,45,90,125,2001,1001]

identify and print the largest number in the array. e.g example above 2001 should be the answer 

**Q.2**

lets say we have a word **“thequickbrownfoxjumsoverthelazydog”** remove every character that appears more than once (will need to search for a method in js that checks if a string holds the same character already). so the answer should reveal **“thequickbrownfxjmpsvlazydg”**
